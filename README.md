## 📖 About the Project

The Amazon rainforest is one of the most vital ecosystems on Earth. Predicting the occurrence of forest fires can help in early warning systems and environmental protection efforts.

This project uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a forest fire based on environmental and meteorological data such as:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Rainfall
- Wind speed
- Month / Season
